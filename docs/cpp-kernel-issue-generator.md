# C/C++ Kernel Implementation Issue Generator

This document describes the automated GitHub Action that generates detailed feature issues with actionable tasks for C/C++ Kernel Implementation in the Echo.Kern DTESN operating system.

## Overview

The **Generate C/C++ Kernel Implementation Issues** workflow creates comprehensive, detailed issues for implementing specific kernel components. Unlike the general roadmap-based issue generator, this workflow focuses exclusively on C/C++ kernel development with detailed technical specifications, performance requirements, and implementation guidelines.

## Features

### ðŸ”§ **Automated Issue Generation**
- Creates detailed implementation issues from a curated feature database
- Includes technical specifications, performance targets, and code templates
- Provides comprehensive testing requirements and acceptance criteria
- Automatically assigns appropriate team labels and categories

### ðŸŽ¯ **Intelligent Filtering**
- Filter by feature category (Core Kernel, DTESN Core, Mathematical Core, etc.)
- Filter by priority level (high, medium, low)
- Preview mode with dry-run capability
- Force recreation of existing issues

### ðŸ“‹ **Comprehensive Issue Content**
Each generated issue includes:
- **Implementation requirements** with checkboxes
- **Technical specifications** with performance targets
- **Code structure** with file organization
- **Testing requirements** with validation criteria
- **Dependencies** and integration points
- **OEIS A000081 compliance** guidelines

```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Relationship to `generate-next-steps.yml`
- **Complementary scope**: Roadmap vs. detailed implementation
- **Different triggers**: Weekly roadmap vs. monthly kernel features
- **Distinct labeling**: `next-steps` vs. `cpp-kernel-implementation`
- **Different audiences**: Project management vs. kernel developers

### Integration Points
- Both workflows reference the same kernel specification documents
- Issues can be linked for traceability
- Completion of kernel implementation issues should update roadmap
- Performance validation feeds into both systems

## Team Assignment

Features are automatically assigned to teams based on category:

| Category | Team Assignment |
|----------|----------------|
| Core Kernel | `team-kernel-team` |
| Hardware Interface | `team-hardware-team` |
| Mathematical Core | `team-math-team` |
| Development Tools | `team-devtools-team` |

## Monitoring and Tracking

### Issue Tracking
- **Primary Label**: Filter by `cpp-kernel-implementation`
- **Category Boards**: Organize by feature category
- **Priority Views**: Sort by priority level
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion via checkboxes

### Performance Monitoring
