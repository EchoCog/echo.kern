## Real-time Programming Standards

All real-time code must:

1. **Deterministic Execution**: Bounded execution time for all operations
2. **Priority Management**: Proper priority assignment and inheritance
3. **Resource Reservation**: Pre-allocated resources for critical operations
4. **Interrupt Handling**: Minimal interrupt latency and jitter
5. **Memory Management**: No dynamic allocation in critical sections

### Example Real-time Scheduler Extension
```c
/**
 * dtesn_schedule_membrane_evolution - Schedule P-system evolution
 * @membrane: Target membrane for evolution
 * @deadline_ns: Absolute deadline in nanoseconds
 * @priority: Scheduling priority (higher = more urgent)
 *
 * Schedules membrane evolution with real-time constraints.
 * Guarantees completion before deadline or returns error.
 *
 * Context: Process context only
 * Timing: Scheduling decision within 2μs
 * Return: 0 on success, -EDEADLK if deadline cannot be met

int dtesn_schedule_membrane_evolution(struct dtesn_membrane *membrane,
                                     uint64_t deadline_ns,
                                     int priority);
```

## Real-time Performance Requirements

| Component | Timing Constraint | Tolerance |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Context Switch | ≤ 5μs | ±1μs |
| Interrupt Response | ≤ 2μs | ±0.5μs |
| Memory Allocation | ≤ 10μs | ±2μs |
| Task Preemption | ≤ 3μs | ±1μs |

## Scheduling Policies

### DTESN Priority Classes
1. **Critical**: Membrane evolution (highest priority)
2. **High**: B-Series computation  
3. **Medium**: ESN reservoir updates
4. **Low**: Documentation and monitoring

### Deadline Scheduling
- Earliest Deadline First (EDF) for DTESN operations
- Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) for periodic tasks
- Deadline inheritance for resource sharing
- Admission control for new tasks

## Memory Management Extensions

### Real-time Memory Policies
- Pre-allocated memory pools for DTESN operations
- Lock-free memory allocators for critical paths
- Memory compaction during idle periods
- NUMA-aware allocation for reservoir data

### Cache Optimization
- Cache-aware data structure layout
- Cache line alignment for critical data
- Prefetching for predictable access patterns
- Cache partition management for DTESN components

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Real-time Tracing
- Low-overhead event tracing
- Timing constraint violation logging
- Performance counter integration
- Real-time system state visualization

### Debug Tools
- Real-time task analyzer
- Deadline miss reporting
- Priority inversion detection
- Cache miss analysis

## Integration with Linux RT

Extensions build upon:
- PREEMPT_RT patch set
- High-resolution timers (hrtimers)
- Real-time mutexes (rt_mutex)
- CPU isolation (isolcpus)
