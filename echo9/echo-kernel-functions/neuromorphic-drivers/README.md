## Driver Development Standards

All neuromorphic drivers must:

1. **Real-time Performance**: Meet strict timing constraints
2. **Event-driven Design**: Use asynchronous, event-based architectures  
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize for ultra-low power consumption
4. **DTESN Integration**: Support DTESN mathematical models
5. **Error Resilience**: Handle hardware faults gracefully

### Example Driver Structure
```c
/**
 * struct neuromorphic_device - Neuromorphic hardware device
 * @base_addr: Device base memory address
 * @irq: Interrupt request line
 * @event_queue: Hardware event queue
 * @power_state: Current power management state
 */
struct neuromorphic_device {
    void __iomem *base_addr;
    int irq;
    struct event_queue *event_queue;
    enum power_state power_state;
};

/**
 * neuromorphic_send_spike - Send spike event to hardware
 * @dev: Neuromorphic device instance
 * @spike: Spike event data
 * @timestamp_ns: Hardware timestamp in nanoseconds
 *
 * Sends a spike event to the neuromorphic hardware with
 * real-time timestamp synchronization.
 *
 * Context: Can be called from interrupt context
 * Timing: Must complete within 5μs
 * Return: 0 on success, negative error code on failure
 */
int neuromorphic_send_spike(struct neuromorphic_device *dev,
                           const struct spike_event *spike,
                           uint64_t timestamp_ns);
```

## Hardware Abstraction Principles

1. **Device Independence**: Abstract hardware differences through common APIs
2. **Real-time Guarantees**: Provide deterministic timing behavior
3. **Event Synchronization**: Maintain precise temporal relationships
4. **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage hardware resources
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation on hardware failures

## Performance Requirements

| Operation | Max Latency | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Spike Transmission | ≤ 5μs | Interrupt context |
| Event Processing | ≤ 10μs | Kernel thread |
| Memory Access | ≤ 1μs | Hardware DMA |
| Power State Change | ≤ 100μs | Process context |

## Testing Framework

Each driver must include:
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing
- Real-time performance validation
- Power consumption measurement
- Fault injection testing
- DTESN integration verification

## Integration with DTESN

Drivers must support:
- OEIS A000081 tree topology mapping to hardware
- P-System membrane computing on neuromorphic substrates
- B-Series computation acceleration
- ESN reservoir state management

## Status

Ready for neuromorphic driver development. Hardware-specific implementations will be added as devices become available.
