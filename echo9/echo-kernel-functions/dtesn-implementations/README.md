## Development Guidelines

All prototypes in this directory must:

1. **Follow OEIS A000081 enumeration**: Validate tree structures against the sequence
2. **Meet coding standards**: Use C/C++ kernel style with DTESN conventions  
3. **Include mathematical documentation**: Reference DTESN mathematical foundations
4. **Provide performance metrics**: Document timing and memory usage
5. **Include test cases**: Comprehensive validation of functionality

## Integration Path

Successful prototypes should be promoted to:
- Main repository root for stable implementations
- `docs/` for architecture documentation updates
- `tests/` for integration into the testing framework

## Status

Ready for DTESN component prototyping. See DEVO-GENESIS.md for development priorities.
